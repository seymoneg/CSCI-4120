# Parameters selected for linear, radial, polynomial kernels
-  {'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100], 'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001], 'kernel': ['linear/radial/polynomial']}

# Results comparison between linear, radial, polynomial kernels
- The best model is radial performance, with a 93% accuracy score. 
- The second best model is linear performance with a 92% accuracy score. 
- The worst model is polynomial performance with a 89% accuracy score.
