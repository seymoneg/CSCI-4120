# Quick Start
# Make sure Jupyter is installed so that you can run jupyter-notebook from the target directory.

# Which K works the best
# Our K's had a similar accuracy of 1.0. There were a couple of K's that had an accuracy of around 0.96. We believe we had an average accuracy of 1.0, because we had all 4 features from the iris data set, and there was no data sparsity. This means that the machine didn't have to go through the data and insert 0's in order to have something to use during analysis.
